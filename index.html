<!-- U = Untracked A = Added M = Modified -->
<!-- Initiation: This is when we add git versionong to a project to track changes. git init -->
<!-- Staged: This is when the file(s) have been added to git, locally. git add nameOfFile OR git add . -->
<!-- Commit: A step ahead of staging that prepares files for branching and pushing to remote. git commit -m "The message" -->
<!-- Push to remote: This is when the files in your local system are transferred to the internet so that they cann shared with another developer or kept for future use.git push-->
<!-- 
    Requirement

    1. You need to create a new repository on github
    2. You need to copy the remote add command eg.
        git remote add origin https://github.com/brytebee/demo_with_bisola.git
    3. You need to run a push command to send your code to the internet.
        git push origin -u <NAME_OF_THE_BRANCH>
   -->
<!-- Remove is the internet and local is your PC. -->
<!-- Git branching: This is the feature used to separate work in git/github. 
  When you create a branch, you essentially create a copy of the changes
  made witht the previous branch and then 
  add new changes from the new branch you've created.
    Git branching is done using the commands below:
        git switch -c <Name_of_branch>
        git chechout -b <Name_of_branch>
 -->
